    "A nested dictionary keeps track of each action and its attributes, and a dictionary keeps track of overall game statistics. A continuous while loop runs that prompts the user for an input, validated by a regular expression search function. If the input is valid, the computer checks the 'count' value in the nested dictionary to see the most commonly chosen action. A list of the tied actions is created if there is a tie, and a key is randomly selected using the choice function. After both sidesâ€™ moves are valid, conditional statements are used to find the winner by comparing their attributes. The dictionaries are updated to reflect the outcome, and another game is played until the user quits."
